# Eye-Movement-Exercise
## Just Look Around
This Exercise creates a second eye and synchronises the movement of the eyes to the movement of the mouse.
How To Run: 
Download the .js, .html and .css files in the Eye Movement repository and load the Index.html file unto a browser to view the eye exercise.

Road Map to Future Improvements:
I hope to improve this in the future by introducing a human head and that moves in the same direction as the eyes.
